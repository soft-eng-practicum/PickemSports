General Description: Pickem Sports is essientially a web-based fantasy sports game offering sports fans a way to compete in a pickem challenege where the user will attempt to choose the most correct winners within a specified length of time. The matchups provided within a particular pickem challenge will vary from the time of the year and the amount of games that are being played that day (or multiple days).
